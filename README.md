mobice android app

Application for reading data from a MUD-game, and matchin it to user-selected searchparameters, then when a match is found, we send a notification to the users mobile phone.
Sadly the project was left unfinished due to some server-related problems and time/energy issues during studies.
Using Google FireBase, done with Android studio.
